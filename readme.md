This is a project where I am trying to recreate spheres in modern versions of vanilla Minecraft.  It is very laggy and the reason so is each of the 1296 blocks (1 every 10 degrees) summons an entity mine-cart with a block suspended above it and because it would auto correct the rotation so another command block kills them all and than they are re-summoned.

As you can see from the screenshot I get very low a fps (though my computer is a potato).
